This project includes a variety of dynamic features: color transformations like RGB to Grayscale, RGB to Binary 🌐, and Grayscale to Binary ⚫⚪; point processing operations such as brightness adjustment ☀, negative transformation 🌑, contrast enhancement 📊, and gamma correction 🌌; and histogram analysis to understand image distributions 📈. The project also explores convolution techniques for blurring using mean and weighted filters ⚖, edge detection (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions 📏), and sharpening in various directions ✨. Frequency domain processing is also featured, including Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms 🔄🔍, along with ideal, Gaussian, and Butterworth filters for low and high pass operations 🌐. The project handles various types of noise, such as salt & pepper 🧂, uniform 📊, and Gaussian noise 📉, with order filters like min, max, median, and midpoint filters 🔄. Erosion is used for refining object boundaries and enhancing details 🌊🛠️, while custom blur exploration allows users to dynamically adjust blur ranges using their mouse 🎨🖱️. The project is implemented with MATLAB for the core image processing functions 💻, a Flutter UI for the mobile interface 📱, and a Flask API to link the two, sending and receiving requests for image transformations 🔄. Using matlab.engine in Flask, I created a backend that processes user requests and delivers the results in real-time. This project seamlessly integrates MATLAB's powerful processing capabilities with an interactive Flutter interface, making advanced image manipulation easily accessible on mobile devices.",

We then handled missing values to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis. Text preprocessing was applied, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization, to prepare the articles for model input. We tested several models, starting with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, followed by the Naive Bayes classifier, which is effective for text classification. We also implemented a Decision Tree model to classify articles by splitting the data into decision nodes, and concluded with Logistic Regression, a linear classifier used to predict the probability of an article being reliable or fake. Each model was evaluated to determine the most effective method for classifying articles accurately.",

The process begins by checking the front sensor for obstacles. If an obstacle is detected in front, the robot proceeds to check the right sensor. If there is no obstacle on the right (i.e., the distance is clear), the robot moves right. If the right side is also blocked, the robot then checks the left sensor. If the left side is clear, the robot moves left. If both the right and left sensors detect obstacles, the robot moves backward to create space and repeats the process. If no obstacle is detected in the front, the robot continues moving forward and keeps checking the surroundings in the sequence (front >> right >> left). This logic is continuously processed by the microcontroller, which controls the motors to adjust the robot's movement in real time, ensuring smooth navigation while avoiding obstacles.",

Using a CNN, the model was trained and tested, achieving 98% accuracy on both the training and test datasets. The CNN architecture consists of convolutional layers to extract features, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator this app consist of two screen first screen you determine height,weight,age and gender and the second screen to show result and know your state throw photo.",
